# 👩‍💻 The Import Users Kata

> This is a refactoring kata 🔧

The kata consists on a single file that read information from different sources
(csv & network), and it must read, parse and print the information on a CLI.

---

A college from your company created a simple script that read users,
unfortunately that person left the company a few months ago, and you need to
change the functionality, but you find out the current code gets more and more
tangled over the time. You talked to your boss, and he decided to give you time
to improve it.

The current code is very basic but no-one feels comfortable or want to modify
it.

The objective of this kata is to improve the current code but maintaining the
original behaviour. Consider testing ("black box" and "white box").

## ⏩ Next iteration

Instead of displaying the output through terminal, store the information somewhere else, like a SQLite or a text file
